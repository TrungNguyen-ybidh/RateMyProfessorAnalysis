    "This code creates an interactive scatter plot that shows how departments' average ratings compare to the number of ratings they’ve received. Departments with ratings of 4 or higher are marked in green, and those with lower ratings are in red. The x-axis represents the average rating, and the y-axis shows the number of ratings. Based on the plot, it looks like higher-rated departments tend to have fewer ratings, while the lower-rated ones have more feedback. Overall, it gives a nice visual of how each department performs and how popular they are."
